				<h1>delve deep</h1>

<p>in honor of side by side's <i>second anniversary</i> on may 14th, we'll be kicking off the month of with a <u>character development challenge</u>! we thought this challenge would be a fun way to look back on the last two years, and to celebrate everyone's writing in the process. whether you joined yesterday or have been here since the start, these prompts are designed to get you thinking about your characters, your writing, and the stories we've created together. 
<p>below are <b>ten prompts centered around character development</b>, each numbered and named for ease of reference. you may interpret these prompts however you wish; there is no right or wrong way to respond to a prompt. they are meant to be thought starters, so follow your heart and get creative! 
<p>to participate in the challenge, write up your responses and post them somewhere in the <a href="https://sideways.jcink.net/?showforum=30">development forum</a> (existing or new topics welcome). then, post in <i>the thread below</i> using the code provided. please only post here once - you may edit your post up until the end of the challenge on <u>may 31st, 2024 at 11:59pm</u>. there is no word count requirement for prompt responses, but we encourage you to delve deep!
<p>you will be rewarded points for each prompt you respond to (per character), and an additional points prize will be given for those who complete all ten unique prompts (across characters). all participants will also receive a special 2nd anniversary badge on the account of their choice. feel free to participate with as many or as little characters as you'd like. we can't wait to see what you all come up with!
